This is just a fun program I decided to write to familiarize myself with assembly language and consequently how computers work. I think that memory and register management
being abstracted away with higher-level programming languages left me unsatisfied; I wanted to learn to program so I could understand and work with computers. RISC-V is the 
first programming language, and this program my first project. I learned everything using free stuff on the internet, almost entirely from 
https://msyksphinz-self.github.io/riscv-isadoc/ (Just a book of ISA specifications and syntax conventions).

I learned alot on the first iteration and am excited for the next; bugs were difficult to fix because my methodology was weird. V2 should turn out better.
